<p>If you want to contact the Trelby development team for any reason, please use the mailing list: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/trelby">http://groups.google.com/group/trelby</a>. Before starting a discussion, please be sure to check the <a title="FAQ" href="http://www.trelby.org/faq">FAQ</a> page first to be sure you're not about to raise a topic discussed many times before.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Trelby was originally known as Blyte, and was written by Osku in 2003-2006 and sold as a commercial program by a company he founded. However, the sales of the program were not enough to justify spending most of his free time working on it, so in 2006 he open sourced it.</p>
<p>The program faded into complete obscurity for five years, until in late 2011, Anil Gulecha <a href="http://www.gulecha.org/2012/01/02/presenting-trelby/">found it</a> and started contributing improvements. This resurrected Osku's interest in the program, and he started working on it again as well.</p>
<p>They decided to change the name of the program to Trelby, create a brand new website for it (the one you're on now), bring the code up to date which it needed after five years of neglect, and try to create a development community around it.</p>
<p>The intersection of software developers and screenwriters is tiny, and is probably the reason for the lack of quality open source screenwriters. If you're a part of that tiny group, why not <a href="http://www.trelby.org/contribute">join in</a>?</p>
