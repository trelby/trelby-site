<p>Q. What’s a screenwriter? TV show and film scripts are written using a certain formatting style. Technically you could open up Notepad, and write your film there, but you’d be tearing your hair apart with setting the formatting. Screenwriting programs, like Trelby, are editors that inherently understand these formatting guidelines, and apply them intuitively, so you can focus on writing your script. Q. What do you mean free and multiplatform? You can use Trelby at a cost of 0$. If you are so inclined, you can even modify Trelby to suit your needs as all of the code is open under the GPL free software license. Trelby runs on both Linux and Windows, and technically on any platform that supports wxWidgets. (If you are a OSX developer, please help port Trelby there as well). Q. What file formats does Trelby support? Trelby has it’s own open, plaintext format (screenplays are saved in .trel files). It also supports encryption (saved as .trelx files). Additionally, Trelby can currently import from screenplay formatted .txt and .rft files. It can also export to .pdf, .txt, and .rtf. Q.
