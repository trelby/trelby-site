<p>.. for those who won't read the <a href="/assets/manual.html" target="_blank">whole manual</a>!</p>
<p>So you want to quickly jump into writing screenplays with Trelby. Here's a few quick tips, tricks and pointers that will make your writing experience better</p>
<h3>1. Elements are first letter shortcuts.</h3>
<p>Want to change the current line to a Dialog? Press Alt + D. Or change it to Action? Press Alt + A. Same goes for the other elements. Or you can right-click on the element with the mouse to get a menu of all possible element types.</p>
<p>Trelby also allows you to change the shortcuts to whatever you want (File/Settings/Change).</p>
<h3>2. Move between scenes.</h3>
<p>Press Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down to goto the next or previous scene.</p>
<h3>3. Typing intelligence.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typing ext. or int. will automatically change the element to Scene.</li>
<li>Trelby will automatically change the case of "i" to "I" as you type.</li>
<li>The first letter of every sentence is automatically set to uppercase.</li>
<li>When you are in an empty Dialogue element and type (, the element automatically changes to a Parenthetical with () text and cursor in the middle.</li>
<li>When you switch a Parenthetical element to another type, and it contains nothing but (), it becomes empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Dual mouse + keyboard selection</h3>
<p>Trelby's selection was written with the keyboard in mind. Say you've made a selection with your mouse. The end of the selection can still be moved with the keyboard using the arrow keys/Page up/down/etc. This allows for easy and accurate selection over multiple scenes and pages. You can cancel the selection by pressing Esc at any time.</p>
<h3>5. Script Errors</h3>
<p>Trelby can find certain errors in your scripts (Script/Find next error, or CTRL+E):</p>
<ul>
<li>An empty line, or a parenthetical element containing only '()'.</li>
<li>A character element that is not followed by a parenthetical or a dialogue element.</li>
<li>A parenthetical element that does not follow a character or a dialogue element.</li>
<li>A dialogue element that does not follow a character or a parenthetical element.</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Control of pages, headers, and element types.</h3>
<p>Trelby allows you to control all aspects of how a script looks. From the page size and margins, to the indentation and width of the different element types, to their look (bold/italic/etc).</p>
<p>See Script/Settings for these options.</p>
<h3>7. PDF capabilities</h3>
<p>Trelby is tuned to generating very compact PDFs.</p>
<p>By default it does not embed the font (and will pick up the default courier on whatever system it is viewed). You can however choose to embed a font of your choice. We recommend the Courier font linked on the <a href="http://www.trelby.org/download">download</a> page.</p>
<h3>8. Fullscreen mode</h3>
<p>Trelby features a no-distraction fullscreen writing mode. Simply press F11 to enter and exit this mode.</p>
