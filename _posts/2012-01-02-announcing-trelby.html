<p>We are happy to announce the release of Trelby 2.0, a simple, free and multi-platform screenwriting program. Rather than restating the feature list, why not head over to the <a href="http://www.trelby.org/" target="_blank">homepage</a> and take a look at all the features Trelby has to offer! Or <a href="http://www.trelby.org/download" target="_blank">download it</a> for your platform.</p>
<p>Trelby is the <a href="http://www.trelby.org/about" target="_blank">rebranding of an older</a> screenwriting program called Blyte, a one-man effort by Osku Salerma, from 2006. The code was open sourced, but did not gain any new developers until October 2011, when Anil Gulecha jumped in being <a href="http://www.gulecha.org/2012/01/02/presenting-trelby/" target="_blank">dissatisfied with available</a> screenwriting options.</p>
<p>Trelby is free software, released under the GPL free software license. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.trelby.org/contribute" target="_blank">contribute page</a> for more information on how to get involved.</p>
