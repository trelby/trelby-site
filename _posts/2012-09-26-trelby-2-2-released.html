<p>We are happy to announce the release of Trelby version 2.2. For Windows and Linux binaries, head on over to our <a href="http://www.trelby.org/download">download</a> page.</p>
<p>Many new features have made it into this release, including the oft-requested undo/redo support.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fountain-document-icon-128.png" alt="" width="128" height="128" />Trelby now supports importing from and exporting to <a href="http://fountain.io">Fountain</a>, a new markup based screenplay format. We've also added import support for Adobe Story and Fade In Pro. The full details can be seen on the <a href="http://www.trelby.org/changes">changes</a> page.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Duan Bailey, Bernhard Reiter and Anthony James Huben for their contributions to this release.</p>
